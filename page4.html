        <i><u>About :-</u></i><br>
        <p>The Japanese Rose Garden is located near the Civil Lines area of Nagpur city.
            It is about 4 km northwest of the city. The Japanese rose garden is designed in
            such a way that people in Japan grow roses or any type of flower and hence it is called
            Japanese rose garden. Red and yellow roses are most beautiful here. Some of these are hybrid
            varieties, some are local. Apart from these there are other green plants and trees as well.

            The gardens are well maintained and neatly manicured. You will also find roses in
            unusual colors like purple and blue. Many birds of different species are seen soaring
            above the clear sky of the Japanese rose garden, while some chirping while sitting on one
            of the branches.</p><br>

        <i><u>About:-</u></i><br>
       
        <p>Maharajbagh zoo is the central zoo of Nagpur, India.
            The zoo is located in the heart of the city and has been built on the garden
            of the Bhonsle and Maratha rulers of the city.[1] The zoo comes under the Central Zoo
            Authority (CZA) of India and is maintained by the Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth
            (PKV) of Nagpur.[2][3] The zoo had come under scrutiny in 2006 for possible closure due
            to issues concerning animal healthcare but was cleared of all objections raised by CZA in 2007.
            The Government of Maharashtra has approved a new safari park of international standards next
            to Gorewada Lake in the city. Animals from Maharajbagh zoo would be moved to this new animal
            park but the older zoo will remain open for new animals</p><br>
