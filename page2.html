         <p>In the western area of Nagpur, ancient Futala Lake has existed for 200 years.
            In the absence of maintenance, the use of this prehistoric lake was limited to cattle washing only.
            It was therefore decided in 2003 to beautify this lake from NIT funds with equal aid from the state
            government.


            Tanga (carriage) at Futala Lake
            The work was done in two stages.
            Desilting was done on large scale along with the removal of lotus plants and other waste from the lake.
            The work included repairing the eastern guard wall of the lake, construction of a pathway with granite
            stone paving, widening of an 18 m wide road under I.R.D.P., roadside guard wall and landscaping berms,
            parking and garden bays on the other side of the road, and fixing decorative lamp, benches, attractive
            dust bins, etc. For watering of plants and landscaping, a sprinkler system was provided.
            For sufficient lighting with four high masts were fixed in the vicinity of the lake.
            Two coloured 15 feet (4.6 m) fountains and a white 100 feet fountain were set up in the lake.
            The work of Immersion Ghat with three ramps on the south side and guard wall of the lake with sand
            beach on the north side was also done in the first phase.</p><br>
